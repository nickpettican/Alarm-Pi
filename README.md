# Pi-Alarm-Clock
Python alarm clock for the RPi, greets 'good morning' and tells the weather

## Motivation
After watching a [YouTube video]('https://youtu.be/julETnOLkaU') by skiwithpete I really wanted to make my own RPi speaking alarm clock. After some source-code reading I decided to go down a slightly different direction from skiwithpete and used **requests** and **pyvona**.

## Requirements
You need Python2.7 to start with, and the following libraries:

* Requests 2.10.0 - don't use 2.11+ because it does not work with pyvona
* Pyvona
* Itertools
* Random
* JSON

## More info soon!
I am currently optimising the structure of the whole program so that both the good morning greeting and the weather are called from a single script efficiently. 
I will probably add more functionality and optimise the speaking!
